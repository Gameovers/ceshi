第一部分：六级英语阅读解析
Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the preparedness of the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many places for centuries and thousands of people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had been curious about the cause of the orbital motion of the moon and planets. What kept them in place? Why didn't they fall out of the sky? The fact that the apple fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been asking himself about those larger fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.
How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree? Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind was ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research. If you don't have unpredictable things, you don't have research. Scientists tend to forget this when writing their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with examples of it.
In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression that they find the "scientific method" a substitute for imaginative thought. I've attended research conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability of continuing a certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said "the data are still inconclusive." "We know that," the men from the budget office have said, "but what do you think? Is it worthwhile going on? What do you think we might expect?" The scientist has been shocked at having even been asked to speculate.
What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own writings. He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes them himself, but has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce results measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe that scientists who know exactly where they are going and how they will get there should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect, is management to be blamed for discriminating against the "odd balls" among researchers in favor of more conventional t
inkers who "work well with the team."

难句解析：
① The fact that the apple fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been asking himself about those larger fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.
这个句子的主干是The fact answered the question。复杂之处在于主语fact跟了一个同位语从句，解释的是fact的内容，注意这个从句中and省略了与前面相同的主语谓语the apple fell；后面的宾语带了一个定语从句，这个从句的引导词that或者which省略了，about短语是对question的解释，those larger fruits of the heavens指的就是the moon and the planets。
找出这个句子的主干，再看主语和宾语的修饰性短语，再一个需要注意的是larger fruits of the heavens和后面the moon and the planets的复指关系。
② In talking to scientists, Particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression that they find the "scientific method" a substitute for imaginative thought.
这个句子的主干是you... gather the impression...，但是它的主要内容集中在impression后面的同位语从句中。在这个解释impression的从句中有一个动词结构find+n.+n.，意思是“觉得……是……”，在本句中是“觉得科学方法是一种替代品”，for后面的短语解释了是什么的替代品。句子开始的介词短语充当的是状语，表示的是这种形象形成的时刻。
可以撇开前面的状语短语，只看主干，重要的是理解that从句中find后面跟两个名词的用法。
③ If experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce results measurable in dollars and cents.
这个主从复合句中的前半部分是if引导的条件从句，这个从句中有一个as... as...的结构，比较施行中的和书面所说的试验的真实度（faithfully），注意后一个as后面跟的是一个句子，其中the report谓语是indicate；后半部分是主句，句中的it是形式主语，代替的是后面for... to...的结构，这是真正的主语。还需要注意的是results后面跟的形容词短语说明的是results的衡量方式。
准确理解as... as...结构，弄清faithfully这个副词修饰的是动词planned and carried out，再就是主句中形式主语的用法，要找到作为真正主语的不定式短语。
④ It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe that scientists who know exactly where they are going and how they will get there should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the other eye is on the microscope.
这个简单句的主语用的是形式主语it，真正的主语是for后面的部分。believe后面跟的是一个that引导的宾语从句，主干是scientists... should not be distracted by...，其中的主语scientists跟了一个who引导的定语从句，这个定语从句的宾语分别是where和how引导的两个从句。by后面名词跟了一个of前导的动名词短语，后面还有一个while引导的伴随状语，表示同时发生的动作。注意动词词组keep an eye on的用法。
抓住believe后面宾语从句的意义，尤其是主语scientists的限定性从句以及by后面名词短语的修饰作用。
⑤ Nor, if regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect, is management to be blamed for discriminating against the "odd balls" among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who "work well with the team."
首先注意这个句子是个倒装句，原因是否定词nor在句首，后面紧跟的是if引导的条件从句，注意其中有一个as... as...的用法，中间跟的是形容词desirable，比较的是科学家对regularity and conformity的希望和他们论文所反映的要求；这样的构成使得主句的主语和谓语is发生了倒装，介词for后面跟动名词短语的是blamed的理由，注意against和in favor of后面各跟了一种不同类型的researchers，最后需要注意的是thinkers后面跟的是who引导的定语从句，起修饰作用。
理解主句的倒装结构是理解这句话的关键，在看这个句子的时候不要忽略了句首的nor，这个单词否定了整个主句。此句的主干是Nor is management to be blamed。
试题解析：
17. 【正确答案】[A]
意为：好奇心比科学实验更重要。第一段第一句指出，在实践中，科学（的进步）更多地依赖于实验的观察者（指做实验的人）的心理准备状况，而更少地依赖于科学所设置的实验。本段其他部分所举的牛顿的例子用于说明这一句阐明的道理；第二段又对这一个例子进行了更具体的总结概括，指出了为捕捉未预料到的现象而做好心理准备的重要性。
　　B意为：当进行有成果的研究时，科学就会进步。C意为：很少有科学家忘记研究的本质内容。D意为：在科学研究中，不可预测性不如预测重要。根据第二段第五、六句，不可预测性是科学研究的本质内容（不可缺少）的一部分。如果没有不可预测性，就无所谓研究。
18. 【正确答案】[B]
意为：不应该忽视对不可预测现象的推测。第二段指出，不可预测性是科学研究的本质内容（不可缺少）的一部分。如果没有不可预测性，就无所谓研究。科学家们在为科学杂志写作千篇一律的报告时往往忘记这一点，但是历史上充满了这样的例子（指像牛顿一样通过预测没有预料到的现象获得重大发现的例子）。
　　A意为：不应该用想像思维代替“科学方法”。第三段指出，在与某些科学家——特别是年轻一点的科学家交谈时，你也许会得到达样一个印象：他们认为“科学方法”可以代替想象思维。可见，有些科学家是遵循“科学方法”的，但是，在他们写作论文时却经常忽视了。C意为：应该为科学杂志撰写更简明的报告。根据文章第三、四段，科学家在撰写论文时经常忽视科学实验中的不可预测性因素，写出的论文给人以错误的印象，似乎科学实验总是能取得预期的结果。可见，这里不是一个简明不简明的问题。D意为：应该对自己的研究发现有信心。第三段举的例子旨在说明：科学家对待科学实验的态度和他们写作论文的方式很不一致，因此容易引起其他人的误解。
19. 【正确答案】 [D]
意为：坚持“科学方法”。参考第18题对选择项A的解释。
　　A意为：对预测很感兴趣。B意为；经常预测未来。C意为：崇尚创造性思维。文章只在第三段第一句提到了年轻科学家的态度。
20. 【正确答案】[A]
意为：可能不像预料的那样有利可图。第四段第三句指出，假如科学实验像科学杂志登载的论文所显示的那样完全按事先的计划设计完成，那么，管理者如果期望实验会产生可以用美元和美分测量的结果就会是完全符合逻辑的。言外之意，科学实验中总是会存在一些难以预测的现象，因此所产生的结果有时难以预测到，因此，不能肯定地说某项实验必定会产生经济效益。
B意为：可以用美元和美分测量。C意为：依赖于与标准模式的一致性。第四段最后一句话的意思是：假如像他们的论文所反映的那样科学家们也想看到规律性和与某种标准模式的一致性，那么，如果管理者们歧视研究者中的“怪人”，而喜欢善于合作的、具有传统思维模式的人，这也是无可指责的。言外之意，科学实验中可能存在很多不可预测现象，如果实验者有充分的心理准备，及时把握住这些现象，突破传统的思维方式，就可能获得更有价值的发明。D意为：大都被管理者低估了。

第三部分  六级听力解读
长对话1：西班牙蔬菜汤
M: What’s all that? Are you going to make a salad?
W: No, I’m going to make a gazpacho.
M: What’s that?
W: Gazpacho is a cold soup from Spain. It’s mostly vegetables. I guess you can call it a liquid salad.
M: Cold soup? Sounds weird.
W: It’s delicious. Trust me! I tried it for the first time during my summer vacation in Spain. You see, in the south of Spain, it gets very hot and summer, up to 42 degrees Celsius, so a cold gazpacho is very refreshing. The main ingredients are tomato, cucumber, bell peppers, olive oil and stale bread.
M: Stale bread? Surely you mean bread for dipping into the soup.
W: No. bread is crushed and blended in, like everything else. It adds texture and thickness to the soup.
M: um…and is it healthy?
W: Sure. As I said earlier, it’s mostly vegetables. You can also add different things if you like such as half-boiled eggs or cured ham.
M: Cured ham? What’s that?
W: That’s another Spanish delicacy. Have you never heard of it? It’s quite famous.
M: No. Is it good too?
W: Oh, yeah, definitely. It’s amazing. It’s a little dry and salty. And it is very expensive because it comes from a special type of pig that only eats a special type of food. The ham is covered in salt to dry and preserve it, and left hung for up to two years. It has a very distinct favor.
M: um, sounds interesting. Where can I find some?
W: It used to be difficult to get Spanish produce here, but it's now a lot more common. Most large supermarket chains have cured ham in little packets. But in Spain, you can buy a whole leg.
M: A whole pig leg? Why would anybody want so much ham?
W: In Spain, many people buy a whole leg for special group events such as Christmas. They cut it themselves into very thin slices with a long flat knife.
Q1 What do we learn about gazpacho?
Q2 For what purpose is stale bread mixed into gazpacho?
Q3 Why does the woman think gazpacho is healthy?
Q4 what does the women say about cured ham?
1。 A。 It is a Spanish soup
2。 C。 To make it thicker。
3。 B。 It is mainly made of vegetables。
4。 D。 It comes from a special kind of pig。
 
长对话2：买酒送上司
M: Hello, I wish to buy a bottle of wine.
W: Hi, yes. What kind of wine would you like?
M: I don’t know. Sorry, I don’t know much about wine.
W: That’s no problem at all. What’s the occasion and how much would you like to spend?
M: It’s for my boss. It’s his birthday. I know he likes wine but I don’t know what type. I also did not want anything too expensive. Maybe middle range. How much would you say is a middle range bottle of a wine approximately?
W: Well, it varies greatly. Our lowest prices are around 60 dollars a bottle but those are table wines. They are not very special and I would not suggest them as a gift. On the other hand, our most expensive bottles are over a hundred and fifty dollars. If you are looking for something priced in the middle, I would say anything between 30 dollars and 60 dollars would make a decent gift. How does that sound?
M: um, yeah. I guess something in the vicinity of 30 or 40 would be good. Which type would you recommend?
W: I would say the safest option is always a red wine. They are generally more popular than whites and can usually be paired with food more easily. Our specialty here are Italian wines and these tend to be fruity with medium acidity. This one here is a Chianti which is perhaps Italy's most famous type of red wine. Alternatively, you may wish to try and surprise your boss with something less common such as this Zinfandel. The grapes are originally native to Croatia, but this winery is in eastern Italy. And it has more spicy and peppery flavor. So, to summarize, the Chianti is more classical and Zinfandel more exciting. Both are similarly priced, and just under 40 dollars.
M: I'll go with Chianti then, thanks.
Q5 What does the woman think of table wines?
Q6 What is the price range of wine the man will consider?
Q7 Why does the woman recommend red wines?
Q8 What do we learn about the wine the man finally bought?
5。 C。 They do not make decent gifts。

8。 C。 It is Italy’s most famous type of red wine。
 
Passage One ： 战时密码
Many people enjoy secret codes. The harder the code, the more some people will try to figure it out. In wartime, codes are especially important. They help army send news about battles and the sizes of enemy forces. Neither side wants its codes broken by the other. One very important code was never broken. It was used during World War II by the Americans. It was a spoken code never written down. And it was developed and used by Navajo Indians. They were called “the Navajo code talkers” the Navajos created the code in their own language. Navajo is hard to learn. Only a few people know it. So it was pretty certain that the enemy would not be able to understand the cold talkers. In addition, the talkers used code words. They called a submarine an iron fish and a small bomb thrown by hand a potato. If they wanted to spell something, they used code words for letters of the alphabet. For instance, the letter A was ant or apple or eggs. The code talkers worked mostly in the islands in the Pacific. One or two would be assigned to a group of soldiers. They would send messages by field telephone to the code talker in the next group. And he would relay the information to his commander. The code talkers played an important part in several battles. They helped troops coordinate their movements and attacks. After the war, the US government honored them for what they had accomplished. Theirs was the most successful wartime code ever used.
Q9 What does the speaker say many people enjoy doing?
Q10 What do we learn about Navajo code talkers?
Q11 What is the speaker mainly talking about?
9。 B。 Decoding secret message。
10。 D。 They helped the U.S。 army in World War Two。
11。 A。 A military code that was never broken。
 
Passage Two：科技会给未来经济/工作带来哪些变化
If you are young and thinking about your career. You want to know where you can make a living. Well, it’s going to be a technological replacement of a lot of knowledge-intensive jobs in the next twenty years. Particularly, in the two largest sectors of labor force with professional skills. One is teaching and the other healthcare. You have so many applications and software and platforms that are going to come in and provide information and service in these two fields, which means a lot of healthcare and education sectors would be radically changed and a lot of jobs will be lost. Now, where will the new jobs be found? Well, the one extra economy can’t be easily duplicated by even smart technologies is the caring sector, the personal care sector. That is, you can’t really get a robot to do a great massage or physically therapy. Or you can’t get the kind of personal attention your need with regard to therapy or any other personal services. They could be very high and personal services. Therapists do charge a lot of money. I think there’s no limit to the amount of personal attention and personal care people would like if they could afford it. But the real question in the future is how come people afford these things if they don’t have money because they can’t get a job that pays enough. That’s why I wrote this book which is about how to reorganize the economy for the future when technology brings about destructive changes to what we used to consider high income work.
Q12 What does the speaker say will happen in the next 20 years?
Q13 Where will young people have more chances to find jobs?
Q14 What does the speaker say about therapists?
Q15 What is the speaker’s book about?
12。 C。 A lot of knowledge-intensive jobs will be replaced。
13。 D。 In the personal care sector。
14。 B。 They charge high prices。
15。 D。 The tremendous changes new technology will bring to people’s lives。
 
Recording 1：美国发现世界上最早铺设的高速公路
American researchers have discovered the world's oldest paved road, a 4,600-year-old highway. it linked a stone pit in the Egyptian desert to waterways that carried blocks to monument sites along the Nile.
The eight-mile road is at least 500 years older than any previously discovered road. It is the only paved road discovered in ancient Egypt, said geologist Thomas Bown of the U.S. Geological Survey. He reported the discovery Friday, "The road probably doesn't rank with the pyramids as a construction feat, but it is a major engineering achievement," said his colleague, geologist James Harrell of the University of Toledo. "Not only is the road earlier than we thought possible, we didn't even think they built roads."
The researchers also made a discovery in the stone pit at the northern end of the road: the first evidence that the Egyptians used rock saws. "This is the oldest example of saws being used for cutting stone," said Bown’s colleague, James Hoffmeier of Wheaton College in Illinois,"That's two technologies we didn't know they had," Harrell said. "And we don't know why they were both abandoned."
The road was discovered in the Faiyum Depression, about 45 miles southwest of Cairo. Short segments of the road had been observed by earlier explorers, Bown said, but they failed to realize its significance or follow up on their observations. Bown and his colleagues stumbled across it while they were doing geological mapping in the region.
The road was clearly built to provide services for the newly discovered stone pit. Bown and Harrell have found the camp that housed workers at the stone pit. The road appears today to go nowhere, ending in the middle of the desert. When it was built, its terminal was a dock on the shore of Lake Moeris, which had an elevation of about 66 feet above sea level, the same as the dock.
Lake Moeris received its water from the annual floods of the Nile. At the time of the floods, the river and lake were at the same level and connected through a gap in the hills near the modern villages of el-Lahun and Hawara. Harrell and Bown believe that blocks were loaded onto barges during the dry season, then floated over to the Nile during the floods to be shipped off to the monument sites at Giza and Saqqara.
Q16:  What do we learn from the lecture about the world's oldest paved road in Egypt?
Q17:  What did the researchers discover in the stone pit?
Q18:  For what purpose was the paved road built?
16。 C。 it linked a stone pit to some waterways
17。 B。 saws used for cutting stone
18。 A。 to provide services for the stone pit。
 
Recording 2：中国针灸疗法
The thin, extremely sharp needles didn’t hurt at all going in. Dr. Gong pierced them into my left arm around the elbow that had been bothering me. Other needles were slipped into my left wrist and, strangely, into my right arm, and then into both my closed eyelids. There wasn’t any discomfort, just a mild warming sensation. However, I did begin to wonder what had driven me here, to the office of Dr. James Gong in New York’s Chinatown.
Then I remembered the torturing pain in that left elbow. Several trips to a hospital and two expensive, uncomfortable medical tests had failed to produce even a diagnosis. “Maybe you lean on your left arm too much,” the doctor concluded, suggesting I see a bone doctor.
During the hours spent waiting in vain to see a bone doctor, I decided to take another track and try acupuncture. A Chinese-American friend recommended Dr. Gong. I took the subway to Gong’s second-floor office, marked with a hand-painted sign.
Dr. Gong speaks English, but not often. Most of my questions to him were greeted with a friendly laugh, but I managed to let him know where my arm hurt. He asked me to go into a room, had me lie down on a bed, and went to work. In the next room, I learned, a woman dancer was also getting a treatment. As I lay there a while, I drifted into a dream-like state and fantasized about what she looked like.
Acupuncturists today are as likely to be found on Park Avenue as on Mott Street. In all there are an estimated 10,000 acupuncturists in the country. Nowadays, a lot of medical doctors have learned acupuncture techniques. So have a number of dentists. Reason? Patient demand. Few, though, can adequately explain how acupuncture works.
Acupuncturists may say that the body has more than 800 acupuncture points. A life force called Qi circulates through the body. Points on the skin are energetically connected to specific organs, body structures and systems. Acupuncture points are stimulated to balance the circulation of Qi.
The truth is, though acupuncture is at least 2,200 years old, “nobody really knows what’s happening,” says Paul Zmiewski, a Ph.D. in Chinese studies who practices acupuncture in Philadelphia.
After five treatments, there has been dramatic improvement in my arm, and the pain is a fraction of what it was. The mainly silent Dr. Gong finally even offered a diagnosis for what troubled me. “Pinched nerve,” he said.

Recording 3：出生顺序对性格以及你与伴侣合拍度的影响
Ronald and Louis married for 2 decades consider themselves a happy couple but in the early years of their marriage both were disturbed by persistent arguments that seemed to fade away without ever being truly resolved. They uncovered clues towards what was going wrong by researching a fascinating subject: How birth order affects not only your personality but also how compatible you are with your mate.
Ronald and Louis are only children, and "onlys" grow up accustomed to be the apple of parents’ eyes. Match two “onlys”, and you have partners who subconsciously expect each other to continue fulfilling this expectation, while neither has much experience in the giving end. Here is a list of common birth order characteristics, and some thoughts on the best and worst, marriage would match for each.
The oldest tends to be self-assured, responsible, a high-achiever and relatively serious and reserved. He may be slow to make friends, perhaps contained with only one companion. The best matches are with a youngest, an only or a mate raised in a large family. The worst match is with another oldest, since the two will be too sovereign to share a household comfortably.
The youngest child of the family thrives on attention, and tends to be out-going, adventurous, optimistic, creative and less ambitious than others in the family. He may lack self-discipline, and have difficulty making decisions on his own.
A youngest brother of brothers, often unpredictable and romantic, will match best with an oldest sister of brothers. The youngest sister of brothers is best matched with an oldest brother of sisters who will happily indulge these traits.
The middle child is influenced by many variables; However, "middles" are less likely to take initiative, and more anxious and self-critical than others. "Middles" often successfully marry other "middles", since both are strong untacked, not so strong on aggressiveness, and tend to crave affection.
The only child is often most comfortable when alone. But since an only tends to be a well-adjusted individual, she’ll eventually learn to relate to any chosen spouse. The male only child expects his wife to make life easier without getting much in return. He is sometimes best matched with a younger sister of brothers. The female only child who tends to be slightly more flexible is well matched with an older man who will indulge her tendency to test his love. Her worst match? Another only. Of course.
